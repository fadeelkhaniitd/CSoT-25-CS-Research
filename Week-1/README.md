## 📬 Submission Details

By the end of **Week 1**, your main deliverable is to implement a basic **Linear Regression** function using **NumPy** and **Pandas** only.

You need to define the function in the following format:

```python
def linearRegression(X: np.array, Y: np.array, lr: float, lambda_: float):
    """
    Parameters:
    - X: Input feature matrix (NumPy array)
    - Y: Target vector (NumPy array)
    - lr: Learning rate (float)
    - lambda_: L1 regularization coefficient (float)

    Returns:
    - weights: Learned model parameters
    """
    pass  # Your implementation here
```
> ✅ **Keep your code clean and well-commented.**  
Submission Instructions will be shared via tha WhatsApp Group.
