## 🌱 What is CAIC Summer of Tech?

**CAIC Summer of Tech** is a 5-week learning initiative by the **Co-curricular and Academic Interaction Council (CAIC)** designed to help freshers and beginners explore tech domains **without pressure or prerequisites**.

Inspired by Inter-IIT Tech Meet problem statements, it offers guided tracks in:

- Generative AI  
- CS Research  
- Cybersecurity  
- Quant & Finance  
- And more...

Each track includes:
- ✅ Bite-sized weekly content  
- ✅ Beginner-friendly, hands-on projects  
- ✅ Mentorship from senior students

> No prior experience? No stress. You’ll learn by building — not before building.

## 🧠 CS Research Track – Problem Statement

### 🔍 Track Overview

In this track, you’ll dive into the world of **Neural Networks**, with a special focus on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** — a foundational architecture for image and pattern recognition.

You’ll go from **training models using real datasets** to **building your own CNN from scratch**, gaining both practical skills and theoretical understanding.

---

### 📚 How It Works

The CS Research track spans 5 weeks:

- **Week 1–2:**  
  - Basics of neural networks  
  - Intro to CNNs and how they work  
  - All concepts explained in beginner-friendly terms

- **Week 3–4:**  
  - Practice: train CNN models on real datasets  
  - Learn how to evaluate performance  
  - Modify architecture and observe outcomes

- **Week 5:**  
  - Build your own CNN from scratch  
  - Experiment by tuning hyperparameters and improving accuracy  

All resources and tutorials will be released **gradually**, so you’re never overwhelmed.

---

### 🎯 Final Goal

> ✅ Implement a working CNN model on a given dataset  
> ✅ Understand how it learns, predicts, and improves  
> ✅ Submit a well-documented notebook or script by the end

---

### 🚀 Stretch Goals (Optional)

- Try **optimization techniques** like learning rate scheduling or Adam optimizer  
- Add **regularization** (e.g., Dropout, L2) to prevent overfitting  
- Compare multiple versions of your model and identify what improves accuracy  
- Explore simple **data augmentation** for better generalization
